Add a loading screen to fill in a nice way the waiting time for the page or items to load.

**Why is it worth it?**

> The loading screen is the perfect fill for the waiting time for an item. In this way, we will avoid the lack of an element or white space when loading the page. This will increase the experience of visitors to the site.

The loading screen may contain only loading animations or animations and logos _(if you are interested in more advanced animation, the price may change)_.
