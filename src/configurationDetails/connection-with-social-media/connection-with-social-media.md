Connect your website with your social media to easily redirect visitors to your website to selected portals.

They can be icons, text or in the form you choose.

**Advantages of adding this functionality:**

- connection with your social media
- pretty graphic element
- the ability to easily redirect website visitors

You can also choose wherever you want to put them _(by default, we put them in the footer of the page)._
