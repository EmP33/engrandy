Add the ability to change the theme of the page.

The default for this package is to change from light to dark mode and vice versa, but this can be freely modified in the order.

The advantage of using this element is that visitors are free to browse the website.

The selected mode will be saved, so when a user visits your site, the appearance of the site will be preserved.
