The ability to change the site language is essential if you want your site to be available in multiple countries.

This package includes adding one additional language to the website (if you want to extend this possibility, you can write about it in the comments).

The language change element is added by default in the navigation bar and in the footer, but the place of adding the element and its appearance are adjusted to your requirements.
